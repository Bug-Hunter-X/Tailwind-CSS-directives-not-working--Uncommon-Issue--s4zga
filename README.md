# Tailwind CSS Directives Not Working

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue where Tailwind CSS directives are not applied correctly.  Despite seemingly correct configuration and class usage, Tailwind styles are not rendered in the HTML.

## Bug Description
The `bg-red-500`, `p-4`, and `text-white` classes should style the div element with a red background, 4 units of padding, and white text. However, this is not happening.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that the div element is not styled as expected.

## Solution
The solution involves a variety of steps that check multiple possible causes of the problem.
