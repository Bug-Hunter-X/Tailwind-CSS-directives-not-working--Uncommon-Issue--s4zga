// Check for typos in class names.
// Check for any CSS overriding Tailwind styles.
//Ensure that your CSS file is being properly imported.
//Verify that the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` includes the correct paths to your HTML and component files. 
//Run npm install or yarn install to make sure all required dependencies are installed.
//Restart your development server or IDE.
//Check for conflicting CSS frameworks or custom stylesheets.
//Examine your browser's developer tools to verify that the Tailwind classes are being applied to the elements (check the elements panel). If the classes aren't there, ensure the files are correctly linked.
//Use `@apply` directives cautiously, and ensure they're correct.
//Make sure that the correct Tailwind CSS version is installed and configured in the project.
